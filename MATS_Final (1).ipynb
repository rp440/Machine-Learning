If a matrix is invertible, then none of its eigenvalues can be zero because the determinant is the product of eigenvalues. But we just established that A has eigenvalues 0 and 1. Therefore, if A is invertible, it would have to have an eigenvalue of 1, which is possible. Wait, but if A is invertible, its determinant is non-zero. However, the determinant of an idempotent matrix can be zero or one. For example, the identity matrix is idempotent and has a determinant of 1, which is invertible. On the other hand, a matrix like [[0,1],[1,0]] is idempotent but has a determinant of -1, which is invertible as well. Wait, no, that matrix is not idempotent. Let me check: [[0,1],[1,0]] squared is [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So, that's idempotent, but its determinant is -1, so it's not invertible. So, it's possible for an idempotent matrix to have determinant 1 (invertible) or determinant -1 (non-invertible). So, can A be invertible? Yes, if its determinant is 1. So, A is not necessarily invertible. Therefore, Option A is not necessarily true.\n",

Therefore, A cannot be nilpotent because nilpotent matrices eventually become zero, but here A is equal to A^2, which is not zero unless A is the zero matrix. Wait, the zero matrix is both idempotent and nilpotent. So, if A is the zero matrix, then it's both idempotent and nilpotent. But the problem doesn't specify that A is the zero matrix; it's just a 3x3 matrix satisfying A² = A. So, A could be the identity matrix, which is idempotent and not nilpotent. Alternatively, A could be a projection matrix onto a subspace, which is idempotent but not nilpotent. So, A can be nilpotent only if it's the zero matrix, which is a possibility, but it's not the only case.

For example, the identity matrix is both orthogonal and idempotent. But, more importantly, if a matrix is orthogonal, then its eigenvalues have absolute value 1, which aligns with our earlier point that eigenvalues are 0 or 1. However, if a matrix is orthogonal, it's necessarily diagonalizable because its minimal polynomial splits into distinct linear factors. Wait, but we already established that Option B is true because the minimal polynomial splits into distinct factors, so A is diagonalizable. So, Option D is not necessarily true because being orthogonal is a stricter condition. For example, consider a rotation matrix by 90 degrees, which is orthogonal but not diagonalizable because it's complex. Wait, but our matrix A is real, right? So, actually, if A is orthogonal and real, it must be diagonalizable because it's a real matrix. Wait, that might not be entirely accurate. For example, rotation matrices in two dimensions are diagonalizable, but in higher dimensions, they might not be. Wait, no, any orthogonal matrix can be diagonalized if it's symmetric, but not all orthogonal matrices are symmetric. Wait, no, in general, orthogonal matrices don't have to be symmetric, but they are always diagonalizable if they are normal matrices. Wait, but a rotation matrix in 3D is not normal because its transpose is not equal to its inverse. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again: If a matrix is orthogonal, it's always diagonalizable because it's a real matrix and its eigenvalues come in complex conjugate pairs if they are not real. But if a matrix is real and diagonalizable, does that mean it's orthogonal? No, because a diagonalizable matrix can have any real eigenvalues, not necessarily ±1. So, for example, a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 2 would not be orthogonal. So, being orthogonal doesn't necessarily make a matrix diagonalizable. Wait, but wait, the minimal polynomial of an orthogonal matrix might not necessarily split into distinct linear factors. For example, the rotation matrix in 2D by 90 degrees is orthogonal and has minimal polynomial x² - 1, which splits into distinct factors, so it's diagonalizable. But a rotation matrix in 3D by 90 degrees is orthogonal but not diagonalizable because it's not symmetric. Wait, actually, in 3D, a rotation matrix is diagonalizable because it can be expressed as a real matrix with eigenvalues 1 and -1, but in this case, our matrix A is idempotent, so it can only have eigenvalues 0 and 1. So, maybe in 3D, an idempotent orthogonal matrix must be diagonalizable. Wait, let's see: If A is orthogonal and idempotent, then A^T A = I and A² = A. So, A^T = A^{-1}. So, since A is orthogonal, its inverse is its transpose. But A² = A implies that A^T A = I, so A^T = A^{-1}. But since A is idempotent, A² = A, so A^{-1} = A. Therefore, A^T = A. So, A is symmetric. Wait, that's interesting. So, if A is orthogonal and idempotent, then A must be symmetric. Therefore, A is both symmetric and orthogonal. Now, symmetric matrices are always diagonalizable because they have an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors. So, A is symmetric and orthogonal, so it's diagonalizable. So, Option D is true because A is orthogonal, which implies it's diagonalizable. Wait, but earlier I thought that orthogonal matrices are diagonalizable, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me check: If a matrix is orthogonal, then it's diagonalizable because it's a real matrix and its eigenvalues are either 1 or -1. Wait, but if a matrix is both orthogonal and diagonalizable, then it must be symmetric. Because for a matrix to be diagonalizable, it must have a complete set of eigenvectors. For real matrices, this requires that the minimal polynomial splits into distinct linear factors, which is the case for orthogonal matrices because their eigenvalues are ±1. But in our case, since A is idempotent, its eigenvalues are only 0 and 1. So, A is diagonalizable because its minimal polynomial splits into distinct linear factors, regardless of whether it's orthogonal or not. Wait, but earlier I thought that if a matrix is orthogonal, it's diagonalizable, but I'm now thinking that being orthogonal is a stronger condition than being diagonalizable. Wait, no, being orthogonal doesn't necessarily make a matrix diagonalizable because the minimal polynomial might not split into distinct factors. For example, a rotation matrix in 3D is orthogonal but not diagonalizable because it's not symmetric. But in our case, A is both orthogonal and idempotent, so A must be symmetric.

The first group is the first three customers, each buying 1 DVD. The second group is the next 689,566 customers, each buying 689,566 DVDs. The last three customers don't buy anything. So, the total number of DVDs sold is the sum of the DVDs from each group. So, the first group contributes 1 DVD per customer, so 3*1=3. The second group contributes 689,566 per customer, so 689,566*689,566. The last group contributes 0, so nothing. Therefore, total DVDs sold is 3 + (689,566 squared).\n",

            "James decides to run 1,793,815 sprints in a week. He runs 60 meters with each sprint. How many total meters does he run in that week? To solve this, you need to multiply 1,793,815 by 60. But since 1,793,815 is a large number, it's better to break it down into smaller parts. Let's see, 1,793,815 can be broken down into 1,000,000 + 700,000 + 90,000 + 3,000 + 800 + 10 + 5. Then, multiply each part by 60 and add them all together. Let's do that step by step.\n",
            "\n",
            "First, multiply 1,000,000 by 60. That's straightforward: 1,000,000 * 60 = 60,000,000.\n",
            "\n",
            "Next, multiply 700,000 by 60. 700,000 * 60 = 42,000,000.\n",
            "\n",
            "Then, multiply 90,000 by 60. 90,000 * 60 = 5,400,000.\n",
            "\n",
            "After that, multiply 3,000 by 60. 3,000 * 60 = 180,000.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, multiply 800 by 60. 800 * 60 = 48,000.\n",
            "\n",
            "Next, multiply 10 by 60. 10 * 60 = 600.\n",

So, I think I need to multiply the number of sprints by the distance per sprint to get the total distance.

        "Alright, so I've got this problem here where James is running a bunch of sprints in a week, and I need to figure out how many total meters he runs. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, the problem says James decides to run 1,793,815 sprints in a week. Each sprint is 60 meters. So, I think I need to multiply the number of sprints by the distance per sprint to get the total distance. That makes sense because if he does 1 sprint, he runs 60 meters, so for 1,793,815 sprints, it should be 1,793,815 multiplied by 60.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let me write that down:\n",
        "\n",
        "Total meters = Number of sprints × Distance per sprint\n",

        "\n",
        "Hmm, okay, so I need to compute 1,793,815 multiplied by 60. I wonder if there's a quicker way to do this without having to multiply each digit one by one. Maybe I can break it down into smaller parts.\n",
        "\n",
        "I know that 60 is the same as 6 × 10, so I can do 1,793,815 × 6 first and then multiply the result by 10. That might make it easier.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let me try that. So, 1,793,815 × 6. Let's compute that.\n",
        "\n",
        "Starting from the right, 5 × 6 is 30. I'll write down 0 and carry over 3.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next digit: 1 × 6 is 6, plus the carried over 3 is 9. Write down 9.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next: 8 × 6 is 48. Write down 8 and carry over 4.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next: 3 × 6 is 18, plus 4 is 22. Write down 2 and carry over 2.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next: 9 × 6 is 54, plus 2 is 56. Write down 6 and carry over 5.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next: 7 × 6 is 42, plus 5 is 47. Write down 7 and carry over 4.\n",

        "\n",
        "Wait, let me double-check that because I might have messed up somewhere.\n",
        "\n",
        "Starting from the right:\n",
        "\n",
        "5 × 6 = 30. So, 0, carry 3.\n",
        "\n",
        "1 × 6 = 6 + 3 = 9. So, 9.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Now, since we had to multiply by 10 earlier, we just need to add a zero at the end. So, 10,762,890 × 10 is 107,628,900.\n",

        "So, the total meters James runs in a week is 107,628,900 meters.\n",

        "Scientific notation is a way of writing numbers as a product of a number between 1 and 10 and a power of 10. So, I need to move the decimal point in 107,628,900 so that there's only one non-zero digit to the left of the decimal.\n",

        "\n",
        "1.076289 × 10^8.\n",
        "\n",
        "Yes, because moving the decimal 8 places to the left gives us 1.076289 × 10^8.\n",
        "\n",
        "But let me verify that. 10^8 is 100,000,000. So, 1.076289 × 100,000,000 is 107,628,900. That's correct.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, the total meters James runs in a week is 1.076289 × 10^8 meters.\n",

What is the total cost he must pay?\"\\n\\nAlright, so I\\'ve got this problem here. It says that at the store, one glass costs $5, but every second glass costs only 60% of that price. Kylar wants to purchase 5,364,765 glasses. I need to find the total cost he must pay.\\n\\nHmm, okay. Let me try to break this down. So, the first glass is $5. The second glass is 60% of $5, which is $3. Then the third glass is $5 again, the fourth is 60% of $5, and so on. So, it\\'s alternating between $5 and 60% of $5.\\n\\nWait, so every pair of glasses costs $5 + (0.6 * $5). Let me calculate that. 0.6 times 5 is 3, so each pair costs $5 + $3 = $8. So, every two glasses, it\\'s $8.\\n\\nNow, Kylar wants to buy 5,364,765 glasses. Let me see how many pairs that is. Since each pair is two glasses, the number of pairs is 5,364,765 divided by 2. Let me compute that.\\n\\n5,364,765 divided by 2 is 2,682,382.5. Hmm, so that\\'s 2,682,382 full pairs and then half a pair. But since we can\\'t have half a pair, we need to consider that the last glass is the first one of the next pair, which is $5.\\n\\nWait, let me think again. If we have an odd number of glasses, like 5,364,765, which is an odd number, then the number of pairs is (5,364,765 - 1)/2, which is 2,682,382 pairs, and then one extra glass. So, the total cost would be 2,682,382 pairs times $8 plus one glass at $5.\\n\\nSo, let me compute that. 2,682,382 times 8. Let me do that step by step. 2,682,382 * 8. Let\\'s break it down:\\n\\n2,000,000 * 8 = 16,000,000\\n\\n682,382 * 8: Let\\'s compute 600,000 * 8 = 4,800,000\\n\\n82,382 * 8: 80,000 * 8 = 640,000\\n\\n2,382 * 8: 2,000 * 8 = 16,000\\n\\n382 * 8: 300 * 8 = 2,400; 80 * 8 = 640; 2 * 8 = 16. So, 2,400 + 640 + 16 = 3,056.\\n\\nSo, adding up:\\n\\n640,000 + 16,000 = 656,000\\n\\n656,000 + 3,056 = 659,056\\n\\nNow, adding that to 4,800,000: 4,800,000 + 659,056 = 5,459,056\\n\\nThen, adding 16,000,000: 16,000,000 + 5,459,056 = 21,459,056\\n\\nSo, 2,682,382 * 8 = 21,459,056\\n\\nThen, adding the extra glass at $5: 21,459,056 + 5 = 21,459,061\\n\\nSo, the total cost is $21,459,061.\\n\\nWait, let me double-check that. So, 5,364,765 divided by 2 is 2,682,382.5, which means 2,682,382 full pairs and half a pair. But since we can\\'t have half a pair, the last glass is the first one of the next pair, which is $5. So, yes, that makes sense.\\n\\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that for every two glasses, it\\'s $8, so for 5,364,764 glasses, which is an even number, it would be 5,364,764 / 2 = 2,682,382 pairs, each costing $8, so 2,682,382 * 8 = 21,459,056. Then, the last glass is $5, so total is 21,459,056 + 5 = 21,459,061.\\n\\nYes, that seems consistent.\\n\\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn\\'t make a mistake in the multiplication. Let me try another way. 2,682,382 * 8. Let\\'s compute 2,682,382 * 8:\\n\\n2,000,000 * 8 = 16,000,000\\n\\n682,382 * 8: Let\\'s compute 600,000 * 8 = 4,800,000\\n\\n82,382 * 8: 80,000 * 8 = 640,000\\n\\n2,382 * 8: 2,000 * 8 = 16,000\\n\\n382 * 8: 300 * 8 = 2,400; 80 * 8 = 640; 2 * 8 = 16. So, 2,400 + 640 + 16 = 3,056.\\n\\nSo, 82,382 * 8 = 640,000 + 16,000 = 656,000\\n\\nThen, 682,382 * 8 = 4,800,000 + 656,000 = 5,456,000\\n\\nWait, no, that\\'s not right. Wait, 682,382 is 600,000 + 82,382. So, 600,000 * 8 = 4,800,000; 82,382 * 8 = 656,000. So, 4,800,000 + 656,000 = 5,456,000.\\n\\nThen, 2,682,382 * 8 = 2,000,000 * 8 + 682,382 * 8 = 16,000,000 + 5,456,000 = 21,456,000.\\n\\nWait, but earlier I had 21,459,056. Hmm, so which is correct?\\n\\nWait, 2,682,382 * 8: Let\\'s compute 2,682,382 * 8.\\n\\nLet me write it down:\\n\\n2,682,382\\n\\nx     8\\n\\n--------\\n\\nStarting from the right:\\n\\n2 * 8 = 16, write down 6, carryover 1.\\n\\n8 * 8 = 64 + 1 = 65, write down 5, carryover 6.\\n\\n3 * 8 = 24 + 6 = 30, write down 0, carryover 3.\\n\\n8 * 8 = 64 + 3 = 67, write down 7, carryover 6.\\n\\n2 * 8 = 16 + 6 = 22, write down 22.\\n\\nWait, but 2,682,382 is 2,682,382. So, let\\'s do it step by step:\\n\\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\\n\\n2 * 8 = 16. Write down 6, carryover 1.\\n\\nNext digit: 8 * 8 = 64 + 1 = 65. Write down 5, carryover 6.\\n\\nNext digit: 3 * 8 = 24 + 6 = 30. Write down 0, carryover 3.\\n\\nNext digit: 2 * 8 = 16 + 3 = 19. Write down 9, carryover 1.\\n\\nNext digit: 8 * 8 = 64 + 1 = 65. Write down 5, carryover 6.\\n\\nNext digit: 6 * 8 = 48 + 6 = 54. Write down 4, carryover 5.\\n\\nNext digit: 2 * 8 = 16 + 5 = 21. Write down 21.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together: 21,459,056.\\n\\nAh, okay, so that\\'s correct. So, 2,682,382 * 8 = 21,459,056.\\n\\nThen, adding the last glass at $5: 21,459,056 + 5 = 21,459,061.\\n\\nSo, the total cost is $21,459,061.\\n\\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way to compute this? Maybe using the formula for an arithmetic series or something.\\n\\nWait, since every two glasses cost $8, and the total number of glasses is 5,364,765, which is an odd number, so the number of pairs is (5,364,765 - 1)/2 = 2,682,382 pairs, and then one extra glass.\\n\\nSo, total cost is 2,682,382 * 8 + 5.\\n\\nWhich is exactly what I did earlier.\\n\\nAlternatively, if I think of it as (number of pairs) * (cost per pair) + (cost of remaining glass).\\n\\nSo, 2,682,382 * 8 + 5 = 21,459,056 + 5 = 21,459,061.\\n\\nYes, that seems consistent.\\n\\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Let\\'s compute the total cost as (number of full pairs) * (cost per pair) + (cost of remaining glass).\\n\\nNumber of full pairs: 5,364,765 divided by 2 is 2,682,382.5, so 2,682,382 full pairs.\\n\\nCost per pair: $5 + (0.6 * $5) = $5 + $3 = $8.\\n\\nSo, 2,682,382 * 8 = 21,459,056.\\n\\nRemaining glasses: 5,364,765 - (2,682,382 * 2) = 5,364,765 - 5,364,764 = 1 glass.\\n\\nCost of remaining glass: $5.\\n\\nTotal cost: 21,459,056 + 5 = 21,459,061.\\n\\nYes, same result.\\n\\nAlternatively, if I think in terms of arithmetic series, but since it\\'s every second glass, it\\'s not a straightforward arithmetic series. So, maybe that\\'s not the right approach.\\n\\nAlternatively, think of it as a sequence where each term is either $5 or $3.50, alternating.\\n\\nBut that might complicate things.\\n\\nAlternatively, think of it as a geometric series, but since the price alternates, it\\'s not a geometric series.\\n\\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think.\\n\\nWait, actually, the price alternates between $5 and $3.50, so the cost per glass alternates between $5 and $3.50.\\n\\nSo, the total cost is the sum of 5,364,765 terms, each term being either $5 or $3.50, alternating every glass.\\n\\nSo, the total cost can be written as:\\n\\nTotal cost = 5 * (number of $5 glasses) + 3.50 * (number of $3.50 glasses)\\n\\nNow, since the number of $5 glasses and $3.50 glasses depends on whether the total number is odd or even.\\n\\nSince 5,364,765 is odd, the number of $5 glasses is one more than the number of $3.50 glasses.\\n\\nSo, let me denote the number of $3.50 glasses as n, then the number of $5 glasses is n + 1.\\n\\nSo, total glasses: n + (n + 1) = 2n + 1 = 5,364,765\\n\\nSo, 2n + 1 = 5,364,765\\n\\nTherefore, 2n = 5,364,764\\n\\nn = 5,364,764 / 2 = 2,682,382\\n\\nSo, number of $3.50 glasses is 2,682,382, and number of $5 glasses is 2,682,383.\\n\\nTherefore, total cost is:\\n\\n5 * 2,682,383 + 3.50 * 2,682,382\\n\\nLet me compute that.\\n\\nFirst, compute 5 * 2,682,383:\\n\\n5 * 2,682,383 = 13,411,915\\n\\nThen, compute 3.50 * 2,682,382:\\n\\n3.50 * 2,682,382 = ?\\n\\nWell, 3 * 2,682,382 = 8,047,146\\n\\n0.5 * 2,682,382 = 1,341,191\\n\\nSo, adding those together: 8,047,146 + 1,341,191 = 9,388,337\\n\\nSo, total cost is 13,411,915 + 9,388,337 = ?\\n\\nLet me add those:\\n\\n13,411,915 + 9,388,337\\n\\n13,411,915 + 9,000,000 = 22,411,915\\n\\n22,411,915 + 388,337 = 22,799,252 + 1,915? Wait, no.\\n\\nWait, 22,411,915 + 9,388,337:\\n\\n22,411,915 + 9,000,000 = 31,411,915\\n\\n31,411,915 + 388,337 = 31,799,252 + 1,915? Wait, no.\\n\\nWait, 31,411,915 + 388,337:\\n\\n31,411,915 + 300,000 = 31,711,915\\n\\n31,711,915 + 88,337 = 31,799,252\\n\\nSo, total cost is $31,799,252.\\n\\nWait, that\\'s different from the previous result of $21,459,061.\\n\\nHmm, so now I have two different results. Which one is correct?\\n\\nWait, so which approach is correct?\\n\\nIn the first approach, I considered that every two glasses cost $8, so 5,364,765 / 2 = 2,682,382.5, so 2,682,382 pairs and one extra glass. So, total cost is 2,682,382 * 8 + 5 = 21,459,061.\\n\\nIn the second approach, I considered that the number of $5 glasses is one more than the number of $3.50 glasses, so 2,682,383 and 2,682,382, and total cost is 5 * 2,682,383 + 3.50 * 2,682,382 = 31,799,252.\\n\\nWait, so which one is correct?\\n\\nWait, let me check with a smaller number. Let\\'s say Kylar wants to buy 3 glasses.\\n\\nIn the first approach: 3 / 2 = 1.5, so 1 pair and 1 extra glass. So, total cost is 8 + 5 = 13.\\n\\nIn the second approach: number of $5 glasses is 2, number of $3.50 glasses is 1. So, total cost is 5*2 + 3.50*1 = 10 + 3.50 = 13.50.\\n\\nWait, but in reality, for 3 glasses, the cost would be:\\n\\nFirst glass: $5\\n\\nSecond glass: 60% of $5 = $3\\n\\nThird glass: $5\\n\\nTotal: $5 + $3 + $5 = $13.\\n\\nSo, the second approach gives $13.50, which is incorrect.\\n\\nTherefore, the second approach is wrong.\\n\\nSo, that means the first approach is correct.\\n\\nTherefore, in the first approach, for 3 glasses, it\\'s 1 pair (2 glasses) costing $8, and 1 extra glass costing $5, total $13.\\n\\nSimilarly, for 5,364,765 glasses, it\\'s 2,682,382 pairs (5,364,764 glasses) costing 2,682,382 * 8 = 21,459,056, plus 1 extra glass costing $5, total $21,459,061.\\n\\nTherefore, the first approach is correct.\\n\\nSo, the answer is $21,459,061.\\n\\nWait, but let me check with another small number to make sure.\\n\\nTake 1 glass: 5.\\n\\nSecond glass: 3.\\n\\nThird glass: 5.\\n\\nFourth glass: 3.\\n\\nFifth glass: 5.\\n\\nSo, for 5 glasses: 5 + 3 + 5 + 3 + 5 = 21.\\n\\nUsing the first approach: 5 / 2 = 2.5, so 2 pairs (4 glasses) costing 2 * 8 = 16, plus 1 extra glass costing 5, total 21. Correct.\\n\\nUsing the second approach: number of $5 glasses is 3, number of $3.50 glasses is 2. So, total cost is 5*3 + 3.50*2 = 15 + 7 = 22. Which is incorrect.\\n\\nSo, the second approach is wrong.\\n\\nTherefore, the first approach is correct.\\n\\nTherefore, for 5,364,765 glasses, the total cost is 21,459,061.\\n\\nSo, I think that\\'s the answer.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe total cost Kylar must pay is \\x08oxed{21459061} dollars.\\n</think>\\n\\nKylar wants to purchase 5,364,765 glasses, where the first glass costs $5 and every second glass costs 60% of that price. \\n\\n1. The cost for the first glass is $5.\\n2. The cost for the second glass is 60% of $5, which is $3.\\n3. The cost for the third glass is $5 again, and the fourth glass is 60% of $5, which is $3.\\n4. This pattern continues, alternating between $5 and $3.\\n\\nTo find the total cost, we note that every pair of glasses costs $8 (since $5 + $3 = $8). \\n\\n5. The number of pairs in 5,364,765 glasses is calculated by dividing 5,364,765 by 2, which gives 2,682,382 pairs with one extra glass.\\n6. The total cost for the pairs is 2,682,382 pairs multiplied by $8, which is $21,459,056.\\n7. The extra glass costs $5.\\n\\nAdding these together, the total cost is:\\n\\\\[ 21,459,056 + 5 = 21,499,061 \\\\]  (Wait, correcting the final addition: 21,459,056 + 5 = 21,459,061)\\n\\nThus, the total cost Kylar must pay is:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\boxed{21459061}\\n\\\\]'"

              "'James decides to run 1,793,815 sprints in a week. \"\\n                   \"He runs 60 meters with each sprint. How many total meters does he run in that week? Please provide your answer in scientific notation.\"\\n\\nAlright, so I\\'ve got this problem here where James is running a bunch of sprints in a week, and I need to figure out how many total meters he runs. Let me try to break this down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, the problem says James decides to run 1,793,815 sprints in a week. Each sprint is 60 meters. So, I think I need to multiply the number of sprints by the distance per sprint to get the total distance. That makes sense because if he does 1 sprint, he runs 60 meters, so for 1,793,815 sprints, it should be 1,793,815 multiplied by 60.\\n\\nLet me write that down:\\n\\nTotal meters = Number of sprints × Distance per sprint\\nTotal meters = 1,793,815 × 60\\n\\nHmm, okay, so I need to compute 1,793,815 multiplied by 60. I wonder if there\\'s a quicker way to do this without having to multiply each digit one by one. Maybe I can break it down into smaller parts.\\n\\nI know that 60 is the same as 6 × 10, so I can do 1,793,815 × 6 first and then multiply the result by 10. That might make it easier.\\n\\nLet me try that. So, 1,793,815 × 6. Let\\'s compute that.\\n\\nStarting from the right, 5 × 6 is 30. I\\'ll write down 0 and carry over 3.\\n\\nNext digit: 1 × 6 is 6, plus the carried over 3 is 9. Write down 9.\\n\\nNext: 8 × 6 is 48. Write down 8 and carry over 4.\\n\\nNext: 3 × 6 is 18, plus 4 is 22. Write down 2 and carry over 2.\\n\\nNext: 9 × 6 is 54, plus 2 is 56. Write down 6 and carry over 5.\\n\\nNext: 7 × 6 is 42, plus 5 is 47. Write down 7 and carry over 4.\\n\\nNext: 1 × 6 is 6, plus 4 is 10. Write down 0 and carry over 1.\\n\\nFinally, the first digit: 1 × 6 is 6, plus 1 is 7. Write down 7.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, 1,793,815 × 6 is 10,762,890.\\n\\nWait, let me double-check that because I might have messed up somewhere.\\n\\nStarting from the right:\\n\\n5 × 6 = 30. So, 0, carry 3.\\n\\n1 × 6 = 6 + 3 = 9. So, 9.\\n\\n8 × 6 = 48. 8, carry 4.\\n\\n3 × 6 = 18 + 4 = 22. 2, carry 2.\\n\\n9 × 6 = 54 + 2 = 56. 6, carry 5.\\n\\n7 × 6 = 42 + 5 = 47. 7, carry 4.\\n\\n1 × 6 = 6 + 4 = 10. 0, carry 1.\\n\\n1 × 6 = 6 + 1 = 7. So, 7.\\n\\nSo, yes, 1,793,815 × 6 is 10,762,890. That seems correct.\\n\\nNow, since we had to multiply by 10 earlier, we just need to add a zero at the end. So, 10,762,890 × 10 is 107,628,900.\\n\\nSo, the total meters James runs in a week is 107,628,900 meters.\\n\\nBut the problem asks for the answer in scientific notation. Okay, so I need to express 107,628,900 in scientific notation.\\n\\nScientific notation is a way of writing numbers as a product of a number between 1 and 10 and a power of 10. So, I need to move the decimal point in 107,628,900 so that there\\'s only one non-zero digit to the left of the decimal.\\n\\nStarting from the right, I move the decimal point 8 places to the left:\\n\\n107,628,900 becomes 1.076289 × 10^8.\\n\\nWait, let me count the places. Starting from 107,628,900:\\n\\n1.076289 × 10^8.\\n\\nYes, because moving the decimal 8 places to the left gives us 1.076289 × 10^8.\\n\\nBut let me verify that. 10^8 is 100,000,000. So, 1.076289 × 100,000,000 is 107,628,900. That\\'s correct.\\n\\nSo, the total meters James runs in a week is 1.076289 × 10^8 meters.\\n\\nBut wait, the problem says he runs 1,793,815 sprints, each 60 meters. Let me just make sure I didn\\'t make any calculation errors.\\n\\n1,793,815 × 60.\\n\\nAlternatively, I can think of 1,793,815 × 60 as 1,793,815 × 6 × 10.\\n\\nWe already did 1,793,815 × 6 = 10,762,890.\\n\\n10,762,890 × 10 = 107,628,900.\\n\\nYes, that\\'s correct.\\n\\nAlternatively, I can compute 1,793,815 × 60 by breaking it down differently.\\n\\n1,793,815 × 60 = (1,793,815 × 6) × 10.\\n\\nWhich is the same as before.\\n\\nAlternatively, I can compute 1,793,815 × 60 as:\\n\\n1,793,815 × 60 = 1,793,815 × (6 × 10) = (1,793,815 × 6) × 10.\\n\\nWhich is the same as before.\\n\\nAlternatively, I can compute 1,793,815 × 60 by multiplying 1,793,815 by 6 and then by 10.\\n\\nWait, but I think I did that already.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute 1,793,815 × 60 by multiplying 1,793,815 by 6 and then adding a zero at the end.\\n\\nWhich is what I did.\\n\\nSo, 1,793,815 × 6 = 10,762,890.\\n\\n10,762,890 × 10 = 107,628,989.\\n\\nYes, that\\'s correct.\\n\\nSo, total the total distance is 107,628,900 meters.\\n\\nExpressed in scientific notation, that\\'s 1.076289 × 10^8 meters.\\n\\nBut let me check if I can round it or if I need to present it with more decimal places.\\n\\nThe problem doesn\\'t specify, so I think 1.076289 × 10^8 is acceptable.\\n\\nAlternatively, if I wanted to write it with two decimal places, it would be 1.08 × 10^8, but since the problem doesn\\'t specify, I think the exact value is better.\\n\\nSo, 1.076289 × 10^8 meters.\\n\\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again because sometimes when you carry over numbers, it\\'s easy to make a mistake.\\n\\nLet me do 1,793,815 × 60 again.\\n\\nAlternatively, I can compute 1,793,815 × 60 as:\\n\\n1,793,815 × 60 = (1,793,815 × 6) × 10.\\n\\nSo, 1,793,815 × 6.\\n\\nLet me compute that again:\\n\\n1,793,815 × 6.\\n\\nStarting from the right:\\n\\n5 × 6 = 30. Write down 0, carry over 3.\\n\\n1 × 6 = 6 + 3 = 9. Write down 9.\\n\\n8 × 6 = 48. Write down 8, carry over 4.\\n\\n3 × 6 = 18 + 4 = 22. Write down 2, carry over 2.\\n\\n9 × 6 = 54 + 2 = 56. Write down 6, carry over 5.\\n\\n7 × 6 = 42 + 5 = 47. Write down 7, carry over 4.\\n\\n1 × 6 = 6 + 4 = 10. Write down 0, carry over 1.\\n\\n1 × 6 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\\n\\nSo, the result is 10,762,890.\\n\\nYes, that\\'s correct.\\n\\nThen, multiplying by 10 gives 107,628,900.\\n\\nSo, 107,628,900 meters.\\n\\nIn scientific notation, that\\'s 1.076289 × 10^8.\\n\\nAlternatively, if I wanted to write it as 1.076289e8, but in standard scientific notation, it\\'s 1.076289 × 10^8.\\n\\nI think that\\'s the answer.\\n\\nJust to make sure, let me compute 1,793,815 × 60 using another method.\\n\\nI can write 1,793,815 × 60 as 1,793,815 × (6 × 10) = (1,793,815 × 6) × 10.\\n\\nWe already did that.\\n\\nAlternatively, I can compute 1,793,815 × 60 by breaking down 60 into 50 + 10.\\n\\nSo, 1,793,815 × 50 + 1,793,815 × 10.\\n\\nCompute 1,793,815 × 50.\\n\\n1,793,815 × 50 is the same as 1,793,815 × 5 × 10.\\n\\n1,793,815 × 5.\\n\\nLet me compute that:\\n\\n1,793,815 × 5.\\n\\n5 × 5 = 25. Write down 5, carry over 2.\\n\\n5 × 1 = 5 + 2 = 7.\\n\\n5 × 8 = 40. Write down 0, carry over 4.\\n\\n5 × 3 = 15 + 4 = 19. Write down 9, carry over 1.\\n\\n5 × 9 = 45 + 1 = 46. Write down 6, carry over 4.\\n\\n5 × 7 = 35 + 4 = 39. Write down 9, carry over 3.\\n\\n5 × 1 = 5 + 3 = 8.\\n\\nSo, 1,793,815 × 5 is 8,969,075.\\n\\nThen, multiply by 10: 8,969,075 × 10 = 89,690,750.\\n\\nNow, compute 1,793,815 × 10 = 17,938,150.\\n\\nNow, add 89,690,750 + 17,938,150.\\n\\nLet me add these two numbers:\\n\\n89,690,750\\n\\n+17,938,150\\n\\n= ?\\n\\nStarting from the right:\\n\\n0 + 0 = 0.\\n\\n5 + 5 = 10. Write down 0, carry over 1.\\n\\n7 + 1 = 8 + 1 (carry) = 9.\\n\\n0 + 8 = 8.\\n\\n9 + 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\\n\\n6 + 9 = 15 + 1 (carry) = 16. Write down 6, carry over 1.\\n\\n9 + 7 = 16 + 1 (carry) = 17. Write down 7, carry over 1.\\n\\n8 + 1 = 9 + 1 (carry) = 10. Write down 0, carry over 1.\\n\\nFinally, 8 + 1 = 9 + 1 (carry) = 10. Write down 0, carry over 1.\\n\\nBut wait, we\\'re at the leftmost digits:\\n\\n89,690,750 has 8 digits, and 17,938,150 has 8 digits.\\n\\nWait, let me write them properly:\\n\\n89,690,750\\n\\n+17,938,150\\n\\n= ?\\n\\nLet me add digit by digit:\\n\\nStarting from the right:\\n\\n0 + 0 = 0.\\n\\n5 + 5 = 10. Write down 0, carry over 1.\\n\\n7 + 1 = 8 + 1 (carry) = 9.\\n\\n0 + 8 = 8.\\n\\n9 + 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\\n\\n6 + 9 = 15 + 1 (carry) = 16. Write down 6, carry over 1.\\n\\n9 + 7 = 16 + 1 (carry) = 17. Write down 7, carry over 1.\\n\\n8 + 1 = 9 + 1 (carry) = 10. Write down 0, carry over 1.\\n\\nNow, the next digits: 8 (from 89,690,750) and 1 (from 17,938,150). Wait, no, actually, the numbers are:\\n\\n89,690,750\\n\\n+17,938,150\\n\\nSo, the digits are:\\n\\n8 9 6 9 0 7 5 0\\n\\n+1 7 9 3 8 1 5 0\\n\\nSo, adding each column:\\n\\nStarting from the right:\\n\\n0 + 0 = 0.\\n\\n5 + 5 = 10. Write 0, carry 1.\\n\\n7 + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9.\\n\\n0 + 8 = 8.\\n\\n9 + 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\\n\\n6 + 9 = 15 + 1 = 16. Write 6, carry 1.\\n\\n9 + 7 = 16 + 1 = 17. Write 7, carry 1.\\n\\n8 + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10. Write 0, carry 1.\\n\\nNow, the next digits: 8 (from 89,690,750) and 1 (from 17,938,150). Wait, no, actually, the first number is 89,690,750, which is 8 digits, and the second is 17,938,150, which is also 8 digits. So, after adding the last digits, we have a carryover of 1, but there are no more digits to add, so we write that 1 at the beginning.\\n\\nSo, the sum is 107,628,900.\\n\\nYes, that\\'s the same result as before. So, 1,793,815 × 60 = 107,628,900 meters.\\n\\nTherefore, in scientific notation, that\\'s 1.076289 × 10^8 meters.\\n\\nI think that\\'s the correct answer. I don\\'t see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I\\'m confident that\\'s the right total distance James runs in a week.\\n</think>\\n\\nJames runs a total of 1.076289 × 10^8 meters in a week.\\n\\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\\n\\n1. **Identify the given values:**\\n   - Number of sprints: 1,793,815\\n   - Distance per sprint: 60 meters\\n\\n2. **Calculate the total distance:**\\n   - Multiply the number of sprints by the distance per sprint.\\n   - Total meters = 1,793,815 × 60\\n\\n3. **Break down the multiplication:**\\n   - Multiply 1,793,815 by 6: 1,793,815 × 6 = 10,762,890\\n   - Multiply the result by 10: 10,762,890 × 10 = 107,628,900\\n\\n4. **Convert to scientific notation:**\\n   - Move the decimal point 8 places to the left: 107,628,900 becomes 1.076289 × 10^8\\n\\n**Answer:**\\n1.076289 × 10^8 meters'"

What is the total cost he must pay?\"\\n\\nAlright, so I\\'ve got this problem here. It says that at the store, one glass costs $5, but every second glass costs only 60% of that price. Kylar wants to purchase 5,364,765 glasses. I need to find the total cost he must pay.\\n\\nHmm, okay. Let me try to break this down. So, the first glass is $5. The second glass is 60% of $5, which is $3. Then the third glass is $5 again, the fourth is 60% of $5, and so on. So, it\\'s alternating between $5 and 60% of $5.\\n\\nWait, so every pair of glasses costs $5 + (0.6 * $5). Let me calculate that. 0.6 times 5 is 3, so each pair costs $5 + $3 = $8. So, every two glasses, it\\'s $8.\\n\\nNow, Kylar wants to buy 5,364,765 glasses. Let me see how many pairs that is. Since each pair is two glasses, the number of pairs is 5,364,765 divided by 2. Let me compute that.\\n\\n5,364,765 divided by 2 is 2,682,382.5. Hmm, so that\\'s 2,682,382 full pairs and then half a pair. But since we can\\'t have half a pair, we need to consider that the last glass is the first one of the next pair, which is $5.\\n\\nWait, let me think again. If we have an odd number of glasses, like 5,364,765, which is an odd number, then the number of pairs is (5,364,765 - 1)/2, which is 2,682,382 pairs, and then one extra glass. So, the total cost would be 2,682,382 pairs times $8 plus one glass at $5.\\n\\nSo, let me compute that. 2,682,382 times 8. Let me do that step by step. 2,682,382 * 8. Let\\'s break it down:\\n\\n2,000,000 * 8 = 16,000,000\\n\\n682,382 * 8: Let\\'s compute 600,000 * 8 = 4,800,000\\n\\n82,382 * 8: 80,000 * 8 = 640,000\\n\\n2,382 * 8: 2,000 * 8 = 16,000\\n\\n382 * 8: 300 * 8 = 2,400; 80 * 8 = 640; 2 * 8 = 16. So, 2,400 + 640 + 16 = 3,056.\\n\\nSo, adding up:\\n\\n640,000 + 16,000 = 656,000\\n\\n656,000 + 3,056 = 659,056\\n\\nNow, adding that to 4,800,000: 4,800,000 + 659,056 = 5,459,056\\n\\nThen, adding 16,000,000: 16,000,000 + 5,459,056 = 21,459,056\\n\\nSo, 2,682,382 * 8 = 21,459,056\\n\\nThen, adding the extra glass at $5: 21,459,056 + 5 = 21,459,061\\n\\nSo, the total cost is $21,459,061.\\n\\nWait, let me double-check that. So, 5,364,765 divided by 2 is 2,682,382.5, which means 2,682,382 full pairs and half a pair. But since we can\\'t have half a pair, the last glass is the first one of the next pair, which is $5. So, yes, that makes sense.\\n\\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that for every two glasses, it\\'s $8, so for 5,364,764 glasses, which is an even number, it would be 5,364,764 / 2 = 2,682,382 pairs, each costing $8, so 2,682,382 * 8 = 21,459,056. Then, the last glass is $5, so total is 21,459,056 + 5 = 21,459,061.\\n\\nYes, that seems consistent.\\n\\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn\\'t make a mistake in the multiplication. Let me try another way. 2,682,382 * 8. Let\\'s compute 2,682,382 * 8:\\n\\n2,000,000 * 8 = 16,000,000\\n\\n682,382 * 8: Let\\'s compute 600,000 * 8 = 4,800,000\\n\\n82,382 * 8: 80,000 * 8 = 640,000\\n\\n2,382 * 8: 2,000 * 8 = 16,000\\n\\n382 * 8: 300 * 8 = 2,400; 80 * 8 = 640; 2 * 8 = 16. So, 2,400 + 640 + 16 = 3,056.\\n\\nSo, 82,382 * 8 = 640,000 + 16,000 = 656,000\\n\\nThen, 682,382 * 8 = 4,800,000 + 656,000 = 5,456,000\\n\\nWait, no, that\\'s not right. Wait, 682,382 is 600,000 + 82,382. So, 600,000 * 8 = 4,800,000; 82,382 * 8 = 656,000. So, 4,800,000 + 656,000 = 5,456,000.\\n\\nThen, 2,682,382 * 8 = 2,000,000 * 8 + 682,382 * 8 = 16,000,000 + 5,456,000 = 21,456,000.\\n\\nWait, but earlier I had 21,459,056. Hmm, so which is correct?\\n\\nWait, 2,682,382 * 8: Let\\'s compute 2,682,382 * 8.\\n\\nLet me write it down:\\n\\n2,682,382\\n\\nx     8\\n\\n--------\\n\\nStarting from the right:\\n\\n2 * 8 = 16, write down 6, carryover 1.\\n\\n8 * 8 = 64 + 1 = 65, write down 5, carryover 6.\\n\\n3 * 8 = 24 + 6 = 30, write down 0, carryover 3.\\n\\n8 * 8 = 64 + 3 = 67, write down 7, carryover 6.\\n\\n2 * 8 = 16 + 6 = 22, write down 22.\\n\\nWait, but 2,682,382 is 2,682,382. So, let\\'s do it step by step:\\n\\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\\n\\n2 * 8 = 16. Write down 6, carryover 1.\\n\\nNext digit: 8 * 8 = 64 + 1 = 65. Write down 5, carryover 6.\\n\\nNext digit: 3 * 8 = 24 + 6 = 30. Write down 0, carryover 3.\\n\\nNext digit: 2 * 8 = 16 + 3 = 19. Write down 9, carryover 1.\\n\\nNext digit: 8 * 8 = 64 + 1 = 65. Write down 5, carryover 6.\\n\\nNext digit: 6 * 8 = 48 + 6 = 54. Write down 4, carryover 5.\\n\\nNext digit: 2 * 8 = 16 + 5 = 21. Write down 21.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together: 21,459,056.\\n\\nAh, okay, so that\\'s correct. So, 2,682,382 * 8 = 21,459,056.\\n\\nThen, adding the last glass at $5: 21,459,056 + 5 = 21,459,061.\\n\\nSo, the total cost is $21,459,061.\\n\\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way to compute this? Maybe using the formula for an arithmetic series or something.\\n\\nWait, since every two glasses cost $8, and the total number of glasses is 5,364,765, which is an odd number, so the number of pairs is (5,364,765 - 1)/2 = 2,682,382 pairs, and then one extra glass.\\n\\nSo, total cost is 2,682,382 * 8 + 5.\\n\\nWhich is exactly what I did earlier.\\n\\nAlternatively, if I think of it as (number of pairs) * (cost per pair) + (cost of remaining glass).\\n\\nSo, 2,682,382 * 8 + 5 = 21,459,056 + 5 = 21,459,061.\\n\\nYes, that seems consistent.\\n\\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Let\\'s compute the total cost as (number of full pairs) * (cost per pair) + (cost of remaining glass).\\n\\nNumber of full pairs: 5,364,765 divided by 2 is 2,682,382.5, so 2,682,382 full pairs.\\n\\nCost per pair: $5 + (0.6 * $5) = $5 + $3 = $8.\\n\\nSo, 2,682,382 * 8 = 21,459,056.\\n\\nRemaining glasses: 5,364,765 - (2,682,382 * 2) = 5,364,765 - 5,364,764 = 1 glass.\\n\\nCost of remaining glass: $5.\\n\\nTotal cost: 21,459,056 + 5 = 21,459,061.\\n\\nYes, same result.\\n\\nAlternatively, if I think in terms of arithmetic series, but since it\\'s every second glass, it\\'s not a straightforward arithmetic series. So, maybe that\\'s not the right approach.\\n\\nAlternatively, think of it as a sequence where each term is either $5 or $3.50, alternating.\\n\\nBut that might complicate things.\\n\\nAlternatively, think of it as a geometric series, but since the price alternates, it\\'s not a geometric series.\\n\\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think.\\n\\nWait, actually, the price alternates between $5 and $3.50, so the cost per glass alternates between $5 and $3.50.\\n\\nSo, the total cost is the sum of 5,364,765 terms, each term being either $5 or $3.50, alternating every glass.\\n\\nSo, the total cost can be written as:\\n\\nTotal cost = 5 * (number of $5 glasses) + 3.50 * (number of $3.50 glasses)\\n\\nNow, since the number of $5 glasses and $3.50 glasses depends on whether the total number is odd or even.\\n\\nSince 5,364,765 is odd, the number of $5 glasses is one more than the number of $3.50 glasses.\\n\\nSo, let me denote the number of $3.50 glasses as n, then the number of $5 glasses is n + 1.\\n\\nSo, total glasses: n + (n + 1) = 2n + 1 = 5,364,765\\n\\nSo, 2n + 1 = 5,364,765\\n\\nTherefore, 2n = 5,364,764\\n\\nn = 5,364,764 / 2 = 2,682,382\\n\\nSo, number of $3.50 glasses is 2,682,382, and number of $5 glasses is 2,682,383.\\n\\nTherefore, total cost is:\\n\\n5 * 2,682,383 + 3.50 * 2,682,382\\n\\nLet me compute that.\\n\\nFirst, compute 5 * 2,682,383:\\n\\n5 * 2,682,383 = 13,411,915\\n\\nThen, compute 3.50 * 2,682,382:\\n\\n3.50 * 2,682,382 = ?\\n\\nWell, 3 * 2,682,382 = 8,047,146\\n\\n0.5 * 2,682,382 = 1,341,191\\n\\nSo, adding those together: 8,047,146 + 1,341,191 = 9,388,337\\n\\nSo, total cost is 13,411,915 + 9,388,337 = ?\\n\\nLet me add those:\\n\\n13,411,915 + 9,388,337\\n\\n13,411,915 + 9,000,000 = 22,411,915\\n\\n22,411,915 + 388,337 = 22,799,252 + 1,915? Wait, no.\\n\\nWait, 22,411,915 + 9,388,337:\\n\\n22,411,915 + 9,000,000 = 31,411,915\\n\\n31,411,915 + 388,337 = 31,799,252 + 1,915? Wait, no.\\n\\nWait, 31,411,915 + 388,337:\\n\\n31,411,915 + 300,000 = 31,711,915\\n\\n31,711,915 + 88,337 = 31,799,252\\n\\nSo, total cost is $31,799,252.\\n\\nWait, that\\'s different from the previous result of $21,459,061.\\n\\nHmm, so now I have two different results. Which one is correct?\\n\\nWait, so which approach is correct?\\n\\nIn the first approach, I considered that every two glasses cost $8, so 5,364,765 / 2 = 2,682,382.5, so 2,682,382 pairs and one extra glass. So, total cost is 2,682,382 * 8 + 5 = 21,459,061.\\n\\nIn the second approach, I considered that the number of $5 glasses is one more than the number of $3.50 glasses, so 2,682,383 and 2,682,382, and total cost is 5 * 2,682,383 + 3.50 * 2,682,382 = 31,799,252.\\n\\nWait, so which one is correct?\\n\\nWait, let me check with a smaller number. Let\\'s say Kylar wants to buy 3 glasses.\\n\\nIn the first approach: 3 / 2 = 1.5, so 1 pair and 1 extra glass. So, total cost is 8 + 5 = 13.\\n\\nIn the second approach: number of $5 glasses is 2, number of $3.50 glasses is 1. So, total cost is 5*2 + 3.50*1 = 10 + 3.50 = 13.50.\\n\\nWait, but in reality, for 3 glasses, the cost would be:\\n\\nFirst glass: $5\\n\\nSecond glass: 60% of $5 = $3\\n\\nThird glass: $5\\n\\nTotal: $5 + $3 + $5 = $13.\\n\\nSo, the second approach gives $13.50, which is incorrect.\\n\\nTherefore, the second approach is wrong.\\n\\nSo, that means the first approach is correct.\\n\\nTherefore, in the first approach, for 3 glasses, it\\'s 1 pair (2 glasses) costing $8, and 1 extra glass costing $5, total $13.\\n\\nSimilarly, for 5,364,765 glasses, it\\'s 2,682,382 pairs (5,364,764 glasses) costing 2,682,382 * 8 = 21,459,056, plus 1 extra glass costing $5, total $21,459,061.\\n\\nTherefore, the first approach is correct.\\n\\nSo, the answer is $21,459,061.\\n\\nWait, but let me check with another small number to make sure.\\n\\nTake 1 glass: 5.\\n\\nSecond glass: 3.\\n\\nThird glass: 5.\\n\\nFourth glass: 3.\\n\\nFifth glass: 5.\\n\\nSo, for 5 glasses: 5 + 3 + 5 + 3 + 5 = 21.\\n\\nUsing the first approach: 5 / 2 = 2.5, so 2 pairs (4 glasses) costing 2 * 8 = 16, plus 1 extra glass costing 5, total 21. Correct.\\n\\nUsing the second approach: number of $5 glasses is 3, number of $3.50 glasses is 2. So, total cost is 5*3 + 3.50*2 = 15 + 7 = 22. Which is incorrect.\\n\\nSo, the second approach is wrong.\\n\\nTherefore, the first approach is correct.\\n\\nTherefore, for 5,364,765 glasses, the total cost is 21,459,061.\\n\\nSo, I think that\\'s the answer.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe total cost Kylar must pay is \\x08oxed{21459061} dollars.\\n</think>\\n\\nKylar wants to purchase 5,364,765 glasses, where the first glass costs $5 and every second glass costs 60% of that price. \\n\\n1. The cost for the first glass is $5.\\n2. The cost for the second glass is 60% of $5, which is $3.\\n3. The cost for the third glass is $5 again, and the fourth glass is 60% of $5, which is $3.\\n4. This pattern continues, alternating between $5 and $3.\\n\\nTo find the total cost, we note that every pair of glasses costs $8 (since $5 + $3 = $8). \\n\\n5. The number of pairs in 5,364,765 glasses is calculated by dividing 5,364,765 by 2, which gives 2,682,382 pairs with one extra glass.\\n6. The total cost for the pairs is 2,682,382 pairs multiplied by $8, which is $21,459,056.\\n7. The extra glass costs $5.\\n\\nAdding these together, the total cost is:\\n\\\\[ 21,459,056 + 5 = 21,499,061 \\\\]  (Wait, correcting the final addition: 21,459,056 + 5 = 21,459,061)\\n\\nThus, the total cost Kylar must pay is:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\boxed{21459061}\\n\\\\]'"
